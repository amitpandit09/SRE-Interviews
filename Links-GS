The question states optimize input in such a way that repeating pattern is replaced with "*"
Example :
input - "ABABCABABCD"
output - "AB*C*D"
Explanation -
Here, till "AB*" of the output, "AB" repeats twice, but till "AB*C*" , "ABABC" repeats twice in the input string

1.) Find the second smallest number in an array.
2.) Given a dictionary of the words(strings) which contains different words & you are given an input string e.g. “abd”. You need to find the largest word available in the supplied dictionary which can be made using the letters of input string. The returned word can contain only the same no of occurrences of the letters as given in the input string i.e. if a letter is given once then in the output it should be existed only once. Examples:


17. 

Input: A 2-D array with name and their score, there can be multiple scores for the same student.
Output: return the max avg of all the students.
Input: There is a Interval class with 3 arguments , startTime, endTime and price, you are given a list of Interval objects, something like : { {1,5,20}, {3,8,15}, {8,10, 8}}. You have to return a list of intervals with startTime, endTime and min privce for that interval.
Output should be : {{1,3,20}, {4,7,15},{8,10,8}

Senior position : 

provided with map of child and parent nodes of tree in a jungle
find the maximum tree and return the id ( root node )
if you find more number of trees return minimum root node value
ex: 1 ( child ) --> 2 ( parent ) , 3 --> 4 , 5 --> 3 --> answer is 4 

Coderpad round - LC Medium, LC Hard (1 hour). Need to pass test cases (limited test cases).

Similar to question https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle-ii/ , only thing is instead of only rowIndex, colIndex was also provided. You need to return the value at particular (rowIndex, colIndex). Did the recursive solution.

Coderpad round: 2 problems were given, 1. Trapping rain water 2. Maximum path sum from bottom-left to top right of an array(Problem statement was different). In this round you will also be asked to provide the test cases to check your function(template of test function was given). I solved both the problems

Round 1 (Coderpad + voice call): Two easy-medium level questions were discussed and you need to write the complete runnable call and pass all the test cases.

Given a String and two words (which occur in the given string), find the minimum distance between two words. Distance between two words is defined as the number of characters between the given two words’ middle characters. The brute-force approach was already implemented but it had some logical bugs, and because of which sample test cases were failing. The objective was to find and fix those bugs and then to add some new test cases and write a code for those test cases as well.
